# fabric

3D elastic simulation with projection and changing view.

Controls:
 - scroll up and down to rotate view around origin
 - left click and drag to pull nodes (does not work with changing perspective yet)

Future developments:
 - change click and drag so always works from the perspective
 - change projection to include fore shortening and make closer links/nodes larger
 - add purely aesthetic polygons to look more like fabric
 - change colour of polygons depending on angle to a 'light source'
